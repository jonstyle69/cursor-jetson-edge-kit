# Project Overview

## What is cursor-jetson-edge-kit?

`cursor-jetson-edge-kit` is a beginner-friendly development kit that helps you build real-world Edge AI demos using Cursor IDE and NVIDIA Jetson devices. It provides a structured workflow, modular code architecture, and practical SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) to make Edge AI development accessible to everyone.

## The Problem It Solves

Many people want to build Edge AI applications but face these challenges:

- **Steep learning curve**: Combining AI models, hardware optimization, and deployment is complex
- **Tool fragmentation**: Different tools for different tasks (model conversion, camera setup, inference)
- **Lack of structure**: No clear workflow for iterative development
- **Hardware complexity**: Jetson setup and optimization can be intimidating

This kit addresses these by providing:
- A clear, modular architecture
- Step-by-step documentation
- AI-powered development workflow with Cursor
- Ready-to-use examples and templates

## Who Should Use This Kit?

- **Half-career-switch engineers**: Transitioning into AI/ML and need hands-on practice
- **Product Managers**: Want to understand Edge AI deployment from a technical perspective
- **Makers**: Have a Jetson board and want to build something practical
- **Self-taught developers**: Learning Edge AI and need structured guidance
- **Anyone**: Interested in combining modern AI tooling (Cursor) with edge hardware (Jetson)

## Why Cursor + Jetson?

### Cursor IDE Benefits

- **AI-powered assistance**: Generate boilerplate code, debug, and iterate faster
- **Context-aware suggestions**: Understands your project structure and suggests relevant changes
- **Rapid prototyping**: Turn ideas into working code quickly
- **Learning accelerator**: See how code should be structured while you build

### Jetson Platform Benefits

- **Real edge deployment**: Not just simulation, but actual hardware
- **Industry standard**: Used in production Edge AI applications
- **Optimized inference**: TensorRT for maximum performance
- **Complete ecosystem**: Camera, sensors, and AI models work together

### The Combination

Together, Cursor + Jetson creates a powerful learning and development environment:
- **Fast iteration**: Cursor helps you code quickly, Jetson lets you test on real hardware
- **Practical learning**: Build real demos, not just tutorials
- **Portfolio building**: Create projects you can show and deploy
- **Career readiness**: Learn tools and workflows used in industry

## Project Goals

1. **Accessibility**: Make Edge AI development approachable for beginners
2. **Structure**: Provide clear workflows and best practices
3. **Modularity**: Build reusable components that can be extended
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for every step
5. **Community**: Create a resource others can learn from and contribute to
